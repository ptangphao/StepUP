## Story

StepUp was a submission to the Hack for Humanity Hackathon on 7/8-7/9/17. 

### Inspiration

Nonprofits today face many challenges - volunteerism is decreasing, but needs of the people supported by nonprofits are complex and growing, especially in areas such as mental health. So many underserved individuals have to cope with not just day-to-day struggles but also long-term impact on their mental health.

Being able to get more mental health providers to volunteer their services can generate huge, immediate impact. Mental health professionals also come from a culture of volunteering and giving back - so what's keeping people from volunteering?

Biggest reason is NOT time or money but lack of drive. Motivation drops when people feel like they are not really making a difference - key drivers include: lack of responsibility or flexibility, no sense of how they're contributing, wasted time on unproductive or unengaging tasks that don't leverage their skills or expertise.

## Introducing stepUp

#### A platform for nonprofits to identify and target specific mental health providers who are more likely to donate their time to clients in need

stepUP aims to deliver much higher volunteer engagement and retention by:


* Increasing responsibility and tailoring assignments to volunteer interest and expertise
* Increasing flexibility (by leveraging technology for remote sessions)
* Tracking and showing the positive impact that these volunteers are generating

### StepUp

### StepUp Scraper API

A Sinatra (Ruby) API that gathers readily available information for mental healthcare providers from PsychologyToday (no API available) utilizing webscraping techniques (Nokogiri) and renders the data in a JSON format.
